# Controller Design Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation of the PID controllers used in the drone's flight control system. The controllers are responsible for managing the drone's attitude, position, and velocity, ensuring stable and responsive flight performance.

## PID Control Theory
PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control is a widely used control algorithm that combines three control actions to achieve desired performance:

- **Proportional (P)**: The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. It provides immediate response to changes in error.
  
- **Integral (I)**: The integral term is concerned with the accumulation of past errors. It integrates the error over time, which helps eliminate steady-state error.
  
- **Derivative (D)**: The derivative term predicts future error based on its rate of change. It provides a damping effect, reducing overshoot and improving stability.

## Controller Implementation
### 1. Attitude Control
The attitude controller manages the roll, pitch, and yaw of the drone. It uses separate PID controllers for each axis to maintain stable orientation during flight.

### 2. Position Control
The position controller manages the drone's position in three-dimensional space (x, y, z). It utilizes feedback from GPS and IMU sensors to adjust the drone's position accurately.

### 3. Velocity Control
The velocity controller regulates the drone's speed in all directions. It ensures that the drone reaches and maintains the desired velocity while responding to changes in flight conditions.

## Sensor Integration
The PID controllers are integrated with various sensors to provide real-time feedback for control adjustments:

- **IMUs**: Used for measuring angular velocity and acceleration, providing data for attitude control.
- **GPS**: Provides position data for the position controller.
- **Airspeed Sensors**: Measures the drone's speed, aiding in velocity control.

## Performance Evaluation
The performance of the PID controllers is evaluated through systematic testing, including:

- **Step Response Testing**: Assessing how quickly and accurately the controllers respond to changes in setpoints.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting PID parameters to optimize performance across different flight conditions.

## Conclusion
The design and implementation of the PID controllers are critical for achieving stable and responsive flight performance in multirotor aircraft. Continuous testing and tuning are essential to ensure robust performance under varying conditions.
