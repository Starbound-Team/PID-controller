# Tuning Methodology for PID Controllers

## Introduction
This document outlines the systematic tuning methodology for the PID controllers implemented in the drone's flight control system. The goal is to achieve optimal performance across various flight conditions by fine-tuning the PID parameters.

## Tuning Methodology

### 1. Initial Parameter Estimation
- **Objective**: Establish a baseline for PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd).
- **Procedure**:
  - Use the Ziegler-Nichols method or similar techniques to estimate initial values.
  - Set Ki and Kd to zero initially and increase Kp until the system oscillates.
  - Record the oscillation period and use it to calculate Ki and Kd.

### 2. Step Response Testing
- **Objective**: Evaluate the system's response to step inputs.
- **Procedure**:
  - Implement a step input in the control loop.
  - Observe the system's response and record the rise time, settling time, and overshoot.
  - Adjust Kp, Ki, and Kd based on the observed performance to minimize overshoot and improve settling time.

### 3. Fine-Tuning for Stability and Performance
- **Objective**: Achieve stable and responsive control.
- **Procedure**:
  - Gradually adjust Kp to improve responsiveness without causing instability.
  - Fine-tune Ki to eliminate steady-state error while monitoring for oscillations.
  - Adjust Kd to dampen any overshoot and improve system stability.
  - Iterate through the tuning process, testing after each adjustment.

## Testing Framework
- Utilize existing tools such as Simulink Waveforms and Graphs for performance evaluation.
- Create test scenarios that simulate various flight conditions (e.g., wind disturbances, rapid maneuvers).
- Document the results of each test, including parameter settings and performance metrics.

## Robust Performance Across Flight Conditions
- Ensure that the tuned PID parameters are tested under different conditions (e.g., varying payloads, battery levels).
- Adjust parameters as necessary to maintain performance across all tested scenarios.

## Documentation
- Maintain detailed records of tuning procedures, parameter settings, and performance evaluations.
- Update this document with findings and adjustments made during the tuning process.

## Conclusion
A systematic approach to tuning the PID controllers is essential for achieving optimal flight performance. By following the outlined methodology, we can ensure robust and stable control of the drone across various flight conditions.
