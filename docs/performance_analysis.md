# Performance Analysis of PID Controllers

## Introduction
This document provides an analysis of the performance of the PID controllers implemented for the multirotor UAV. The focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of the controllers in managing attitude, position, and velocity during flight operations.

## Performance Metrics
To assess the performance of the PID controllers, the following metrics are considered:
- **Rise Time**: The time taken for the system output to rise from a specified low value to a specified high value.
- **Settling Time**: The time taken for the system output to settle within a certain percentage of the final value.
- **Overshoot**: The amount by which the output exceeds the desired value during the transient response.
- **Steady-State Error**: The difference between the desired setpoint and the actual output as time approaches infinity.

## Testing Methodology
The performance of the PID controllers was evaluated using the following procedures:
1. **Simulation Testing**: Initial tests were conducted in a simulated environment to analyze the response of the controllers under various conditions.
2. **Flight Testing**: Real-world flight tests were performed to validate the controller performance in dynamic environments.

## Results
### Attitude Control
- **Roll Control**: The PID controller demonstrated a rise time of X seconds, settling time of Y seconds, and an overshoot of Z%.
- **Pitch Control**: Similar performance metrics were observed, with adjustments made to the PID parameters to optimize response.
- **Yaw Control**: The yaw control exhibited minimal steady-state error, indicating effective control.

### Position Control
- **X, Y, Z Positioning**: The position controllers showed effective tracking of setpoints with rise times averaging A seconds and settling times averaging B seconds.

### Velocity Control
- The velocity controller maintained a steady-state error of C m/s, with rise times and settling times comparable to position control.

## Conclusion
The PID controllers implemented for the UAV have shown promising performance across various flight conditions. Further tuning and adjustments may be necessary to enhance stability and responsiveness, particularly in challenging environments.

## Future Work
- Implement advanced tuning methodologies such as Ziegler-Nichols or Cohen-Coon for further optimization.
- Explore the integration of adaptive control techniques to improve performance in varying flight conditions.
